description: Create a commit message by analyzing git diffs
allowed-tools: Bash(git status:*), Bash(git diff --staged), Bash(git commit:*)
---

## Context:

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff: !`git diff --staged`

Analyze above staged git changes and create a commit message. Use present tense and explain "why" something has changed, not just "what" has changed.

## Commit types:

Only use the following types:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `refactor:` - Refactoring code
- `docs:` - Documentation
- `style:` - Styling/formatting
- `test:` - Tests
- `perf:` - Performance
- `chore:` - If it doesn't fit in any of the others

## Format:

Use the following format for making the commit message:

```
<type>: <concise_description>
<optional_body_explaining_why>
```

## Output:

1. Show summary of changes currently staged
2. Propose commit message with appropriate emoji
3. Ask for confirmation before committing

DO NOT auto-commit - wait for user approval, and only commit if the user says so.
